## Project Overview
The project focuses on leveraging machine learning for predicting traffic volume, which is crucial for smart city planning. It aims to address traffic congestion issues by providing insights into traffic patterns and predicting future traffic volume. By utilizing historical and real-time data, the project aims to contribute to efficient traffic management and urban mobility.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used contains records of traffic volume at different junctions at specific dates and times. It includes features such as date time, junction, vehicles count, and ID. These features are crucial for understanding traffic patterns and predicting traffic volume.

## Preprocessing
During preprocessing, features such as hour, day, month, and year are extracted from the date time column to capture temporal patterns. The dataset is then split into features and target variables, and categorical variables are handled appropriately.

## Target Concept
The target concept is the traffic volume represented by the vehicles column. The goal is to accurately predict traffic volume based on given features, contributing to efficient traffic management and smart city planning.

## Machine Learning Model Selection
The Decision Tree Regressor model is chosen for its suitability for regression tasks, interpretability, ability to handle categorical variables, and non-linear relationships.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the training data and evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared. These metrics quantify the model's performance and its ability to predict traffic volume accurately.

## Implementation
The implementation involves steps such as data loading, preprocessing, feature selection, dataset splitting, model training, and testing using Python programming language and relevant libraries.

## Evaluation & Results Discussion
The model's performance is evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics. Results indicate the model's ability to make accurate predictions and explain variability in traffic volume. Further analysis involves interpreting results in the context of the problem and examining model predictions.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting traffic volume for smart city planning. Insights gained from the project could contribute to efficient traffic management and infrastructure development, leading to smarter and more sustainable cities.
